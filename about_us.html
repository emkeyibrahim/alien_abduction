    	<p>While Kellogg’s still lead the breakfast cereals market, other competitors are increasingly making forays and Kellogg’s must consistently strive to better position its brands if it is to maintain profitability (Calkins, 2008, p. 21). Our goal is to increase sales through advertising and create a sense of wistfulness to revenue from the product. Kellogg’s website and the social media will also be used to create awareness for the product and to interact with our customers. Ultimately, our mission is to create a lasting image of a tasty breakfast cereal in the minds of consumers to boost sales and improve the company’s image. </p>
